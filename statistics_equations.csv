Name, Equation/Variable, Usage,in python script or not,
sample-size, n, if large enough the sampling distribution of xbar is approximately normal,n/a,
sample-mean, "xbar=sum(x_1,x_2,...)/n = (1/n)(sum(x_i))",,yes- mean(),
sample-variance: unbiased, "s^2=((sum((x_i-xbar)^2))/(n-1),,yes- as s_variance(),
sample-variance: biased, "s^2=((sum(x_i-xbar)^2)/(n)",,yes- as s_variance(),
sample-standard-deviation, "s=sqrt(((sum(x_i-xbar)^2)/(n-1))=sqrt(s^2)",,yes- as stnd_dev(),
sampling-distribution-mean, ,greek letter "mu",n/a,
confidence-interval: sigma is known, Z=(xbar-mu)/(sigma/sqrt(n)),rarely used,yes- as con_int(),
confidence-interval: sigma is unknown, T=(xbar-mu)/(s/sqrt(n)),commonly used,yes- as con_int(),
mu: if sigma is known, "[(xbar-(Z(sigma/sqrt(n))),(xbar+(Z(sigma/sqrt(n)))]", very rare to be used,yes- as solve_mu(),
mu: if sigma is unknown, "[(xbar-(T(s/sqrt(n))),(xbar+(T(s/sqrt(n)))]", common to be used,yes- as solve_mu(),
confidence coefficient (aka confidence level), 1-alpha or 1-beta, alpha is for type I error/confidence and beta is for type II error/confidence,yes- confidence(),
alpha,,greek letter used to denote type I error rate,n/a,
beta,,greek letter used to denote type II error rate,n/a,
five-number-summary, "Minimum,Q1,Median(Q2),Q3,Maximum", these numbers are the numbers illisrated in a boxplot,yes- fivenum(),
Q1,,first quartile of the dataset the value separating the lowest 25% from the upper 75%: the median of the values below the median of the dataset,yes- q1 from fivenum(),
median,,the value which separates the upper 50% from the lower 50% the middle number in the dataset-not the average,yes-median() or q2 form fivenum(),
Q3,,the third quartile or median of the upper 50% of the dataset,yes- q3 from fivenum(),
